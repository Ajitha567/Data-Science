This project focuses on developing an AI-powered disease prediction model utilizing patient health data to forecast the likelihood of diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's disease. By analyzing various health metrics, the model aims to assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and personalized treatment planning. The dataset used in this project is sourced from the provided Google Drive link:

Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access the dataset. The dataset is in CSV format and contains approximately 768 records with 8 health-related attributes, including age, blood pressure, and BMI. The target variable indicates the disease outcome (1: Positive, 0: Negative). The project employs machine learning techniques to develop a predictive model, evaluates its performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and provides insights into the most influential health metrics affecting disease outcomes. Tools and technologies used include Python, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn, with the development carried out in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab environments. The project workflow encompasses data loading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model building, evaluation, and optional deployment for real-time predictions.
